# PrognosticSepsis
Septicemia or Sepsis is an infectious disease that has a high mortality rate, mainly affecting those who had a relatively low immunity such as newborns, pregnant women and the elderly, in addition to being developed from contamination, either by contact, by air or hospital, high in mortality is directly linked to the time it takes to diagnose this disease and its treatment. Thus, the diagnosis allowed the disease and his health to cause an electronic automation in a personâ€™s devices. In addition, correcting the initial treatment of this disease infers a reduction in the risk of death for patients with this disease. This presents a supervised model for the preventive work of patients who present symptoms of sepsis. The machine consists of building learning learning models without predicting a prediction in EPSE data prediction from data obtained in models - and monitoring available internal ICU data from internal collaboration data available on PhysioNet.
